# SMARTMIRROR

notes for myself:
  venv is there so use it
  used expo not react native
  for face recg to work you need to open two js and one py file
  there is gonna be quite a bit of useless "MAIN.js" file so yeah
  keytester.js is for API key testing
  mousecontroller work like shit
  terrible structure but no routing just stright one file babyyyy
  face recg file is in the main file

stuff that need to be changed:
  routing!! routing!! one file code base is driving me nuts
  better everything( structure tracking ect)
